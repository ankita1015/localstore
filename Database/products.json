Thus it is extensively used in heavy gauge welded components (over about 6mm). There is commonly no appreciable price difference between 316 and 316L stainless steel.\r\n\r\nThe austenitic structure also gives these grades excellent toughness, even down to cryogenic temperatures.\r\n\r\nCompared to chromium-nickel austenitic stainless steels, 316L stainless steel offers higher creep, stress to rupture and tensile strength at elevated temperatures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMechanical Properties\r\n\r\nTable 2.
